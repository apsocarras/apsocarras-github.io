(Old Version, Before Tech Impact)

I am a recent graduate of the data engineering track at Epicodus, a 27-week full-time software development bootcamp. Prior to a shift in career goals, I 
was a data analyst working in public health and preparing for Ph.D. programs in biostatistics. But I eventually realized that building software (and 
breaking it) was more exciting to me than academic research.

Currently, I am a Data Engineering Intern at Pandata, where I'm working on deploying a multi-modal ML pipeline using AWS. I am also studying for the AWS 
SAA Exam as I look for further employment opportunities in the field. Please see my resume and some of my projects to get a better idea of my skills and 
experience.
